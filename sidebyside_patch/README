Side-by-side installation is essential part of 
game software distribution.
To apart from system singleton value (environment
variable, registry, and absolute path), I made patches
to Glib2, Pango, and fontconfig.

Glib2 : version 2.4.6
Pango : version 1.6.0
fontconfig : to CVS current (2004/09/09)

Apartment is not perfect. Some basic environment variables
take effects yet, like TEMP, LC_ALL, and LC_MESSAGES.
