SDL_PangoDraw
=============

This is a fork of SDL_Pango, a library to render text in SDL using the Pango layout engine.
The name has been changed to avoid confusion.

This fork is based on the original 0.1.3 branch in CVS.  The names of tags have been changed for clarity in Git.

The original SDL_Pango is by NAKAMURA Ken'ichi and 0.1.2 can be found here:
