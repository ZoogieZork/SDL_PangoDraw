\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make
\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11  sure the software is free for all its users.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too,
\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11  but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 
of use, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can ch
\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 a\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 nge the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rig\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 
hts.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rig\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 
hts that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making ch
\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 a\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 nges to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 
 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by probl
\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 e\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 ms that might be introduced by others.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license f
\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 rom a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 
 General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking 
\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 t\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 hose libraries into non-free programs.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Publi
\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 c License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public Li\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 cense because it does }{\i\f11\fs20\kerning0 \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 Less}{\f11\fs20\kerning0 \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 
 to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordina
\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 ry General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 
 it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting t
\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 h\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 e free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permissio\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 
n to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 
 does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  P\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 
ay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11

\par 
\par \hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a libra\hich\af11\dbch\af23\loch\f11

odification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent
