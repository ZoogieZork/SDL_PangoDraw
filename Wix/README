These files are about merge module.

Prepare WiX (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix)
and libXSLT.
I use libXSLT in cygwin.

run ./configure at parent directory.
It makes Makefile from Makefile.in.

You should set LIGHT_PATH environment variable for
prefix of Pango-related binaries (i.e., C:\msys\1.0\local).
SDL.dll must be placed on current directory.
SDL_Pango.dll must be placed on ..\VisualC2003\Release.
And 'make merge_module'.

If you want to make sample MSI file, you should place
testbench.exe on ..\VisualC2003\testbench\Release. 
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Merge Modules\VC_User_CRT71_RTL_X86_---.msm
should be there.
And 'make testbench'.

If you want to make development library MSI file, 
SDL_Pango.lib must be placed on ..\VisualC2003\Release.
And 'make dev_vc'.
